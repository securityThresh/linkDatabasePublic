(sdelete)
download an put into C:\Windows\System32
cmd //open eingabeaufforderung
sdelete -p 1 -z c: //run sdelete once, overwrite all free space with Zeros, do that for laufwerk c
explanation:
The base command sdelete -c <drive letter> deletes free disk space on the specified drive securely. 
Here are some examples that demonstrate the various options that SDelete offers:
sdelete -c c: -- Deletes the free disk space on drive C: securely.
sdelete -c -p 2 f: -- Runs two delete passes on the free disk space of drive f:
sdelete -z d: -- Zeroes the free disk space of drive d:
SDelete uses the Department of Defense algorithm by default when it deletes files, folders or free disk space. 
The -z parameter overwrites the free disk space with zeroes instead which is faster.
